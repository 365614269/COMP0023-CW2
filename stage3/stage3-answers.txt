Q1. The forwarding path is cust1 -> r0 -> prov0. At Time 4, r0 processes the first 'send' event. The destination IP 100.128.0.1 matches the most specific prefix known at this time: 100.0.0.0/8, which was advertised by prov0. The alternative, more specific route (100.128.0.0/24 from prov1) is not advertised until Time 6. Therefore, r0 selects the route via prov0. The packet is not dropped by r0; it is forwarded (consumed) by the next-hop router, prov0.
Q2. The revenues will change 1 time between time 9 and 14. This change occurs at Time 10 when the new advertisement from cust0 for prefix 2.3.0.0/24 is processed. This advertisement offers a path via a Customer (Revenue: +5). This immediately overrides the previously selected path via prov0 (Revenue: -3). Since the primary routing decision factor in EGP is Local Preference (tied to revenue), the network revenue switches from incurring a cost (-3) to generating revenue (+5) for that specific prefix.
Q3. The forwarding path is cust1 -> r0 -> prov0. The 'send' event at Time 10 is processed before the advert event at the same time step. When r0 checks its Forwarding Information Base (FIB) to route the packet to 2.3.0.6, it still uses the existing best path. This existing path is the one learned at Time 1 via prov0. The decision to switch the preferred route to cust0 is only made after the advertisement is processed, which happens after the packet is forwarded. The packet is not dropped by r0; it is forwarded to prov0.
Q4. The forwarding path is peer1 -> r0 -> cust0. By Time 18, r0 has updated its routing table based on the Customer advertisement at Time 10 (and its refinement at Time 17). The best path to 2.3.0.6 is definitively through the Customer, cust0. The packet source, peer1, is a Peer. Standard BGP (EGP) policy dictates that transit traffic from a Peer to a Customer is allowed (valley-free routing). r0 acts as a transit AS, forwarding the packet from the free-exchange neighbor (peer1) to the paying neighbor (cust0). The packet is not dropped and is forwarded to cust0.
Q5. The revenues will change 0 times between time 16 and 25. The only routing-related event in this window is an addprivatepath update at Time 17, which refines the AS-Path for the 2.3.0.0/24 route from cust0 (Path: C H I to C I). This event only affects the secondary tie-breaker (AS-Path length). Since cust0 was already selected as the best route based on the primary criterion (Local Preference/Revenue), the route's next-hop remains the same. Therefore, the revenue achieved for that prefix, which is fixed at +5 (Customer revenue), does not change.
